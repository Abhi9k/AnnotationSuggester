# AnnotationSuggester
In this project, we are trying to analyse Annotation Usage patterns in Java Projects. We will also try to find some interesting correlations, and use that knowledge to develop a 'suggestion tool', to help developers catch annotation related bugs without running or compiling the application. 

## Setup
    pip install --user javalang
    pip install --user requests

## Run
    python CodeParser.py
